# GoodGhosting Hodl Pool

GoodGhosting is a DeFi Protocol currently live on Polygon & Celo, which is revolutionizing the savings domain by gamifying it and rewarding regular savers.

You can read more about the [V0 Version](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v0#readme) to get a better understanding of the protocol.

With the GoodGhosting Hodl Pool, we aim to improve on the protocol and make it more fair, rewarding and more yield generating opportunities for regular savers in addition to the hodl feature.

## Notable Features in Hodl Pool

- **Different segment and waiting round length** as the word "hodl" the hodl pool aims to reduce the player's interaction with smart contract so the hodl pools can have just 1 deposit segment and 3/6 month waiting period.

- **Flexible Amount Deposit Pools** yes you heard it correct, this option will enabled while deployment of pool contract, there will be a max. amount limit but players can choose any valid amount but once you choose the amount you have to deposit the same amount in each segment.

- **Accounting of the interest and rewards distributed to winners** To introduce fairness unlike v0, the share of interest and rewards for winners will be decided by how much you deposit (in case of a flexible deposit pool) and how early you deposit in each segment.

- **Multiple Yield Strategies** the new hodl pool smart contract architecture allows to have multiple sources for yield strategies other than aave and moola like curve, mobius etc and many more in the future.

## Types of Pools

- **Fixed Deposit Pool with same waiting segment duration** Native Pool where the deposit amount is fixed for each player and the waiting round duration is fixed too.

- **Fixed Deposit Pool with waiting round duration more than payment segment duration** Fixed Deposit Hodl Pool basically which will have less player interaction in terms of sending transactions i.e a pool with 1 deposit segment of 1 week and 3 months of waiting round.

- **Flexible Deposit Pool with same waiting segment duration** Flexible Deposit Amount Pool where the deposit amount is decided by the player while joining and the waiting round duration is fixed too.

- **Flexible Deposit Pool with waiting round duration more than payment segment duration** Flexible Deposit Amount Hodl Pool basically which will have less player interaction in terms of sending transactions i.e a pool with 1 deposit segment of 1 week and 3 months of waiting round.

- **Transactional Token Pool** Fixed or Flexible Deposit pool with transactional token as deposit for example a pool with matic as deposit token.

- **Deposit Token same as reward Token** Fixed or Flexible Deposit pool with deposit token and reward token same for example a pool with wmatic as deposit token.

## Pool Interest Accounting Math

As mentioned above with this new version of the GoodGhosting Protocol we aim to introduce fairness in terms of interest and reward generation for winners, and we are doing this by computing player share % which is computed based on the deposit amount made by each player and how early does a player pay in each segment, so below is an explanation of the math behind this feature.

In the new version of the [Pool Smart Contract](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/Pool.sol) we have a couple of mappings defined `playerIndex[player_address][segment_number] & cumulativePlayerIndexSum[segment_number]`

```
Now as each player starts making deposits the mappings are updated as follows:
playerIndex = deposit_amount * (MULTIPLIER_CONSTANT) / block.timestamp

for (each segment paid by the player) {
cumulativePlayerIndexSum[current_segment] += playerIndex
}

cumulativePlayerIndexSum as you see is updated for every new deposit for each segment (reason for updating it in each segment is explained in the next section)

here MULTIPLIER_CONSTANT is used since solidity cannot handle decimal values it is a very large constant 10**8

so the playerIndex updates for each player during each deposit.
```

So once the game get's over when the players withdraw the interest & reward share is calculated as:

```
uint playerIndexSum = 0;
for (each segment paid by the player) {
playerIndexSum += playerIndex
}

playerSharePercentage = playerIndexSum * 100 / cumulativePlayerIndexSum[last_segment]

playerSharePercentage is the % of funds the winners get from the total game interest and total rewards generated by the game.
```

Couple of examples

- A Game with 2 winners who deposited different amounts and at different times

```
There are 2 players in the game with only 1 segment and it's a flexible deposit pool, player1 deposits 10 DAI & player 2 deposits 100 DAI, but player 1 deposits early than player 2.

player1Index = 10 / 5 = 2
player2Index = 100 / 20 = 5

so hence cumulativePlayerIndexSum will be 7 and even though player 2 deposits late but the amount is 10x more than player 1 so player2 in the end get's about 72 % of the rewards and player1 get's the remaining 28 %.
```

- A Game with 2 players, 1 early withdrawal

```
There are 2 players in the game with only 1 segment and it's a flexible deposit pool, player1 deposits 10 DAI & player 2 deposits 100 DAI, but player 1 deposits early than player 2

player1Index = 10 / 5 = 2
player2Index = 100 / 20 = 5

so hence cumulativePlayerIndexSum will be 7, now the twist is that player 2 early withdraw's so cumulativePlayerIndexSum then becomes 2, and hence player 1 get's all the interest and rewards earned.
```

## Emergency Scenario

With Hodl Pools especially there comes a risk of funds being locked in the external protocol in case something happens or if an external protocol utilized by one of the goodghosting pools migrates to a new contract in the middle of a game. So to handle these scenario's we have a introduced a new function in the smart contract (enableEmergencyWithdraw)[https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/Pool.sol#L572] which can only be called by the contract deployer aka the admin.

Once this function is called, it updates the last segment value to current segment & makes the emergency flag true in the smart contract, players then who have deposited in the prev. segment i.e current segment - 1 are all considered as winners and they can withdraw their funds immediately once the emergency flag is enabled.

The mechanism for fixed and variable deposit pool still applies i.e for fixed deposit pools complete funds are redeemed at once but for variable deposit pools each winner would only redeem their own funds(principal + interest + rewards).

**NOTE** - Handling this emergency early exit is the reason `cumulativePlayerIndexSum` is a mapping.

# Smart Contract Overview

> As you can see in order to make our contracts modular we have divided the contracts into two types, the pool contract which holds all the core game/pool logic and the yield strategy contracts so in a way the pool contract is the parent contract and players cannot directly interact with the strategy contracts, only the pool contract can, so while deploying the pool we set the address of the strategy we want to use for that pool, below is an in depth explanation of each contract.

<br/>

- **[Pool](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/Pool.sol)** is the core contract with only the game logic in it, it's the parent contract through which players are able to make deposits into various yield strategy contracts and withdraw funds.

- **[IStrategy](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/strategies/IStrategy.sol)** is the interface that all strategy contracts inherit so that it becomes straightforward to plug and play any strategy in the pool contract.

- **[AaveStrategyV3](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/strategies/AaveStrategyV3.sol)** is responsible for depositing funds that it gets from the pool contract to aave v3 and withdraw the funds from there and send back to the pool contract.

- **[AaveStrategy](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/strategies/AaveStrategy.sol)** is responsible for depositing funds that it gets from the pool contract to aave v2/moola and withdraw the funds from aave/moola and send back to the pool contract.

- **[CurveStrategy](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/strategies/CurveStrategy.sol)** is responsible for depositing funds that it gets from the pool contract to curve stable/volatile pools and withdraw the funds from curve stable/volatile pools and send back to the pool contract, current pools supported are AAVE Stable Pool `0x445FE580eF8d70FF569aB36e80c647af338db351` & Atricrypto Volatile Pool `0x1d8b86e3d88cdb2d34688e87e72f388cb541b7c8`.

- **[MobiusStrategy](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/strategies/MobiusStrategy.sol)**: is responsible for depositing funds that it gets from the pool contract to any mobius liquidity pool and withdraw the funds from that mobius liquidity pool and send back to the pool contract, current pools that were tested with are cUSD / DAI Pool `0xF3f65dFe0c8c8f2986da0FEc159ABE6fd4E700B4` & cUSD / USDC Pool `0x9906589Ea8fd27504974b7e8201DF5bBdE986b03`

- **[NoExternalStrategy](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/contracts/strategies/MobiusStrategy.sol)**: works like an escrow for pool funds like the name suggests the funds do not get invested anywhere and it supports multiple reward tokens.

# Development

The repository uses both hardhat and truffle.
**Hardhat**

- Unit Tests
- Aave Strategy Pools Fork Tests

**Truffle**

- Curve, Mobius and Moola Fork Tests
- All mainnet deployments

# Tests

## Unit Tests

**Requirements** :

- Make sure the `FORKING` var in .env is set false before running the unit test suite.
- Make sure the `MNEMONIC` var in .env is set as "here is where your twelve words mnemonic should be put my friend" before running the unit test suite.

To run the unit tests use either
`yarn test`

To run test coverage: `yarn coverage`

NOTE - If you run any test command after `yarn coverage` you will see an error

```
An unexpected error occurred:

**just ignore this error and run the command again**

## Integration Tests Using Forked Networks

### Setup

To run the integrated test scenarios forking from Mainnet (Polygon or Celo) you'll have to:

- Configure `WHALE_ADDRESS_FORKED_NETWORK` in your `.env` file, as you see the .env.example file the whale address is `0x075e72a5edf65f0a5f44699c7654c1a76941ddc8` for polygon & `0x5776b4893faca32A9224F18950406c9599f3B013` for celo.

- Update the strategy type in the deployment config and the inboundCurrencySymbol value according to the type of strategy you want to deploy.

- Review the deployment configs ([deploy-config.js file](./deploy-config.js)) prior to executing the test on the forked network.

- You'll also need a rpc provider the best option for polygon is infura for celo you can use their public rpc `https://forno.celo.org/`

### Steps

#### Polygon

- **Aave V2/V3 Strategy Based Pool** As mentioned above we use hardhat for this, after doing the setup mentioned above, the next step is to set the `FORKING` var in your .env file as `true`, next in your [config](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/hardhat.config.ts#L62) you set your desired rpc url, currently a public rpc is set. Then you just run `yarn test`.

- **Curve Strategy Based Pool** As mentioned above we use truffle for this, so open a new terminal window and run `ganache-cli -f <Your Polygon RPC> -m "clutchaptain shoe salt awake harvest setup primary inmate ugly among become" -i 999 --unlock {WHALE_ADDRESS_FORKED_NETWORK}` and in the second window run `yarn test:fork:polygon` for fixed deposit pool & `yarn test:fork:variable:polygon` for variable deposit pool.

#### Celo

Since hardhat currently does not support celo, so we use truffle for celo fork tests. To start open another terminal window and run
`ganache-cli -f https://forno.celo.org/ -m "clutchaptain shoe salt awake harvest setup primary inmate ugly among become" -i 999 --unlock {WHALE_ADDRESS_FORKED_NETWORK}` and in the second window run
`yarn test:fork:celo` for fixed deposit pool, `yarn test:fork:variable:celo` for variable deposit pool/

# Security Tools

There's a few automated security tools that could be integrated with the development process. Currently, we use [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) to help identify well-known issues via static analysis. Other tools may be added in the near future as part of the continuous improvement process.

## Slither

Make sure you install Slither by following the instructions available on [Slither's](https://github.com/crytic/slither) github page. Note: it requires Python, so you may need to install it before you're able to use Slither.

Slither can be executed with the following command:

```bash
slither . --filter-path "aave|Migrations.sol|merkle|mock|openzeppelin|polygon|aaveV3|curve|mobius"
```

# Contract Deployment

- You'll need a rpc provider the best option for polygon is infura for celo you can use their public rpc `https://forno.celo.org/`

- Update the `strategy` value and the `inboundCurrencySymbol` value according to the type of strategy you want to deploy in the deployment config.

- All Deployment Info would be written in the [deployment log file](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/deployment-result.json).

## Polygon

- **Aave V3 Strategy Based Pool** After setting the prerequisite config mentioned above, start by setting the `MNEMONIC` var (which is the 12 word seed phrase in your wallet) & the `RPC` var in the .env file & then make sure you have the [right deployment configs set](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/deploy.config.ts)(if a **whitelisted pool** needs to be deployed make sure the merkle root is set and the [isWhitelisted var](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/deploy.config.ts#L135) is true), then just run `yarn deploy:polygon`.

You will see something like this:

## Celo

- **Mobius Strategy Based Pool** After setting the prerequisite config mentioned above, start by setting the `CELO_PRIVATE_KEY` var which is the private key of your celo wallet & then make sure you have the [right deployment configs set](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/deploy.config.ts)(if a **whitelisted pool** needs to be deployed make sure the merkle root is set and the [isWhitelisted var](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/deploy.config.ts#L135) is true). Open the terminal window and run `yarn deploy:celo`.

You will see something like this:

### Merkle Root Generation for Whitelisted Contracts

To deploy the `WhitelistedPool` contract, a merkle root is required, introduced for the purpose of whitelisting users. The merkle root can be created by using the repo below:

Clone this [repository](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/Whitelisting)

Install Dependencies: `yarn install`

Edit this [file](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-whitelisting/blob/master/scripts/input.csv) with the addresses you want to whitelist, keeping the JSON format same.

Run: `yarn generate-merkle-root`

You should see an output similar to this:

`{ "merkleRoot": "0xc65049d2040e43b130c923276515ed14d241ac88d28f0c03384d5b5f7197be82", "claims": { "0xBE73748446811eBC2a4DDdDcd55867d013D6136e": { "index": 0, "exists": "true", "proof": ["0x1f122d8c45929e68268031d8ce59ea362ab716d6b93f3b226c4cdcf459c766b3"] }, "0xb9a28ce32dcA69AD25E17212bC6D3D753E795aAe": { "index": 1, "exists": "true", "proof": ["0xdbab8c7f829217c06dc0a73baaefdbfd9e15c463a255e1b3947b27f7792462de"] } } }`

Copy the value of the `merkleRoot` field, and replace the merkle root parameter in the [deploy.config.js](https://github.com/Good-Ghosting/goodghosting-protocol-v1/blob/master/deploy.config.ts) file. Once this step is done, the contract can be deployed using the deployment instructions provided above.
